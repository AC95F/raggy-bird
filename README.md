# Raggy Bird
A personalized clone of the original Flappy Bird game I made in a month.

This was written in C++ using SFML and compiled with Cmake, as a personal project for learning purposes.

The gameplay differs slightly and is tuned for an easier and more enjoyable experience.

It features both a start and end screens, sound effects, music and a highscore system.

The game can be launched using the raggy-bird.exe file inside the /build directory.
